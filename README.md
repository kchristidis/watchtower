# Watchtower

NC State ECE Senior Design Project, Fall 2015

## Description

Monitor the state of a building (temperature, luminosity, number of people) with easy-to-deploy Pi-based sensor boxes and an intuitive Web interface.

Allow others to access a sensor box you own using the dashboard.

Use the REST API to programmatically export sensor data, and build applications on top of **Watchtower**.
