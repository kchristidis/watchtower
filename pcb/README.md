  - `sensor_pcb.brd` is the board file for EagleCAD for the PCB in our project that connects to the Raspberry Pi
  - `sensor_pcb.sch` is the schematic file for EagleCAD for the PCB in our project that connects to the Raspberry Pi
  - `gerber-files` contains all the files needed when sending the PCB to a manufacturer

When soldering the sensors on there is a label next to each set of wholes on the top side saying which sensor goes where, and on the under side shows a `V` for where the positive voltage pin should go. For a more simple explanation of how to orient the sensors, when looking at the side with the name labels and with the double row of pin wholes on the top you want each sensor to be mostly to the right of the pin wholes that go with that sensor.
